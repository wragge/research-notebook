Tjuringas are sacred stones or pieces of wood belonging to members of certain tribes in Central Australia. Tjuringa is an Aranda term. The Tjuringa represents the essence of spirit of the human totemite (the owner of the Tjuringa). On the Tjuringa will be carved some device peculiar to the totem of the owner. The Tjuringas are sacred and are not to be seen by women or uninititated children. They are kept in sacred storehouses, caves holes in rocks, etc. Each tribal group has its own sacred storehouse / photographer, G Cribb. 1 photographic negative: b&w, acetate

Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islander peoples - Implements and weapons - A pointing bone - a kangaroo bone with hair string attached. It is used by medicine men and others having magical powers to accomplish the death of an enemy. One method is to place the bone in position, pointing at the person whose death is desired, while he is sleeping. When he awakes he sees the pointing bone and generally accepts this as his death warrant / photographer, G Cribb. 1 photographic negative: b&w, acetate

| Total | 222,287 | 291,172 | 136,851 |  185,108 |

Note that a distinction is made for the first time between 'simple' and 'complex' access examination.

>  Simple access examination is managed within the Archives.
 
>  Complex access examination generally requires referral to other departments or agencies for expert advice on exemptions. This category includes material with ongoing national security, defence and international relations sensitivities.

There was also a review of access procedures (p. 4):

>  The Archives Act provides a general right of access to most government records. Records are examined for public access in response to a request from a researcher or as part of our program of proactive examination of records. A significant risk associated with this is the inadvertent release of exempt information, especially that which retains ongoing national security, defence or international relations sensitivities.
>  
>  To address this, during the year we commissioned an external review of our access examination processes. This review, together with a previously commissioned review, resulted in recommendations to reduce this risk. The majority of recommendations were implemented, including the establishment of a new business unit dedicated to the access examination function, construction of a secure accommodation area, and installation of a dual-site local area network to manage highly classifi ed and sensitive information. Further, an interdepartmental committee on the public release of classified and sensitive archival records was established to oversee the development of whole-of-government access examination processes.

p. 169 -- definition of 'Access Examination':

>  The process of examining records to i dentify any exempt information they may contain.

>  Significant resources were committed to improve the timeliness of examination and to resolve a backlog of approximately 20,000 applications. The Archives undertook extensive consultation with researchers and agencies, and with their support an access examination taskforce was established in October 2013 to target the backlog. The taskforce released records relating to more than 7457 applications. In addition, the taskforce globally opened 357,434 records not requiring examination. A backlog of 12,543 applications remained at 30 June 2014, and will continue to be addressed by the Archives.
